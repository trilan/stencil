Stencil
=======

Stencil creates files and directories from templates. It is inspired by Paste
Templates, but Stencil has no dependencies.

Install Stencil with pip::

    $ pip install Stencil


Usage example
-------------

There is currently only one template provided by Stencil. It creates a package
with new stencil, e.g.::

    $ stencil new newsuperstencil
